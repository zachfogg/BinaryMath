# Binary Math
Defitions of numerical operations.

## Objectives
Implement operators from the following categories:

1. Bitwise
2. Mathematical
3. Boolean

## Rules and Restrictions
The only operators allowed are &&, ||, and !.

To implement logic, check bit truthiness and/or use functions that do the same.
*For example, one could recursively implement multiplication as repeated addition.*

Use only the binary type 'bin'. Do not convert between bases.

### Exceptions
* Exceptions are provided for creating simple loops.
* You may use + and - to adjust for array indexing
