# libbin
Definitions and implementations of bitwise, numerical, and logical operations.


## Rules and Restrictions
The only operators allowed from the C language are `&&`, `||`, and `!`.

To implement logic, check bit truthiness and/or use functions that do the same.

Use only the type `bin` as defined in `./src/16.h`.

You may not convert between bases.

Write unit tests for new features.

### Exceptions
* Minor exceptions to these rules will be allowed to create simple loops.
* You may use + and - to adjust for array indexing.


## Objectives
Implement operators from the following categories:

1. Bitwise
    * NOT
    * AND
    * OR
    * XOR
    * Most significant bit
    * Least significant bit
    * Shift left and right
    * Rotate left and right
2. Math
    * Add
    * Subtract
    * Multiply
    * Divide
    * Modulus
    * Exponentiate
    * Logarithm
3. Boolean
    * Equality
    * Greater than
    * Less than
    * Greater than or equal to
    * Less than or equal to
    * Negation
    * Conjuction
    * Disjunction
